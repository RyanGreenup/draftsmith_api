Draftsmith is notetaking tool that uses PostgreSQL as a backend to implement full text search and semantic search via an openAI API. This is an API that is used to interact with the database and can be implemented by any front-end application, basically a bring your own GUI.

See the PyQt6 GUI implementation [here (TODO)] and the Neovim Extension [here (TODO)]. The docker container is packaged with a flask server.

It is designed to be a simple, fast, and reliable way to take notes, whilst remaining feature complete and open source.
